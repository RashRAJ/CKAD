# CKAD In 30 Days

Welcome! This repository contains notes, Kubernetes manifest examples, and exercises gathered while studying for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured collection of resources to aid in learning and preparing for the CKAD certification. It includes daily study notes, practical YAML examples, and exercises to reinforce concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   **/Notes**: Contains Markdown files with daily study notes covering various CKAD topics (e.g., `Day1.md`, `Day2.md`, etc.). These notes summarize key concepts and commands.
*   **/Manifests**: Includes example Kubernetes YAML manifest files for different object types (Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps, etc.). These can be used for hands-on practice with `kubectl apply`.
*   **/Exercises**: Contains exercises related to the topics covered in the notes, along with their solutions (e.g., `Day5Task.md`).

## How to Use

1.  **Follow the Notes**: Start with `Day1.md` in the `/Notes` directory and progress sequentially.
2.  **Practice with Manifests**: Use the YAML files in the `/Manifests` directory to create, inspect, and manage Kubernetes objects in a test cluster (like Minikube or Kind).
3.  **Complete the Exercises**: Work through the tasks in the `/Exercises` directory to test your understanding.
